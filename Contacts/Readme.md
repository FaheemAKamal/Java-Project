## Contacts Application
Project for CSC 221 - Software Design Lab at the City College of New York.
## About The Project
- Created a Contacts application in JavaFx. 
- Store the contacts information in an ObservableList of Contact object.
- A contact should contain first name, last name, email and phone number properties.
- When the user selects a contact from the contacts list, its information should display in a Grid of Text Fields. 
- As the information is modified (A Contact’s data is updated, a new Contact is added or an existing Contact is deleted), the contacts ListView should display the updates. 
- The ListView should display the Contact’s last name. Also provide a custom ListView that display’s the Contact’s full name and picture with the names sorted by last name.
