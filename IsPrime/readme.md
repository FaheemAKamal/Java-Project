## Prime Test
Project for CSC 221 - Software Design Lab at the City College of New York.
## About The Project
- A program that takes a whole number input from a user and determines whether it’s prime. If the number is not prime, display its unique prime factors. 
- Remember that a prime number’s factors are only 1 and the prime number itself. Every number that’s not prime has a unique prime factorization.
- For example, consider the number 54. The prime factors of 54 are 2, 3, 3 and 3. When the values are multiplied together, the result is 54. For the number 54, the prime factors output should be 2 and 3. 
- Used Sets as part of the solution.
