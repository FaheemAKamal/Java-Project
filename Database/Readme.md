## Library Database
Project for CSC 221 - Software Design Lab at the City College of New York.
## About The Project
- Consider the management and maintenance of a &quot;library database&quot; in a certain school. It holds the information of material resources in use for students in that school. This information is recorded based on the object-oriented design. The skeleton of the database structure is shown using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagramming method illustrated below. 
- UML&#39;s standard notion is still being finalized for global use, and so annotations such as (has-a) to express object composition and (implements) to express inheritance are added to the diagram:

- The above structure shows object variables and constructors only. Plus sign (+) indicates public visibility whereas minus sign (-) sets out private scope.
- The Database may use ArrayList instead of Array to hold the collection of Item&#39;s references. Add an appropriate set of overloading/overriding methods to support the object hierarchy assumed in this context.
- Implement the hierarchy, populate Database with at least two items per non-abstract class, and show the &quot;unsorted&quot; and &quot;sorted&quot; list of the set of those instances. 
- The minimal requirement of this assignment is to realize the database sort based on the lexicographical order of id as well as any combination of data variables. For instance, database records are shown based on the lexicographical order of &quot;title,&quot; followed by&quot;addedOn,&quot; and followed by &quot;director.&quot;
## Additional Information
- There are comments in the code that illustrates the thought process and exactly what each line of code is doing.
